## Projects

#### Eye Tracking Report using Tobii Pro Lab

+ This project was meant to analyze video recordings from participants observing tobacco ads. In particular, an eye tracking software was used to evaluate their attention measures for advertisements with and without flora. This study identified how eco-friendly marketing features in tobacco ads impact attendance to the message, cognitive and affective response, product risk perception, attitude, and use intentions in young adults. The primary outcomes focused on neural signals within the cerebral cortex, but for this report we are concerned with the eye fixations, and fixation time between eco-friendly regions of tobacco ads and non-eco-friendly regions of the ad. Evaluation of an in-class pilot data of eye tracking was the focus for this exploratory study. This was completed for Johns Hopkins “Engineering and Measuring Influence” course.

#### Brain Study using fNIRS and RStudio

+ This project was meant to study how the brain processes information. Furthermore, how the brain responds to different advertisements using neural data analysis techniques with NIRX NIRSport fNIRS. 24 subjects in Amman, Jordan were recruited for this experiment to view video advertisements intended to reduce sectarianism throughout the Middle East. Activity in the neural biomarkers located in the prefrontal cortex were correlated with self-reported response to key behavioral questions to evaluate the effectiveness of the videos for reducing sectarianism among targeted population. This was completed for Johns Hopkins “Engineering and Measuring Influence” course. Key activities in this project included:
+ Key Activities: NIRSLab neural data analysis, Manipulation and statistical inference using R

#### Conceptual Systems Design for Hurricane Disaster Relief Recovery System

+ The team designed a Hurricane Disaster Relief Recovery System, “Eye of the Storm” focusing on hurricanes in Miami (within FEMA Region IV). This was completed for Johns Hopkins “Systems Conceptual Design” course. Key activities within this project included:
+ Key Activities: Overall System Description, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), CONOPS Use Case Development, System Operational Requirements, Capability Development, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), Functional Block Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Physical Architecture Development, Traceability Matrixes, System Trade Studies, Risk Assessment and Calculations

#### Nautilus Proposal  (UAV Solicitation for Proposal)

+ The team developed a proposal to SPAWAR to cover the work for the UAV (underwater autonomous vehicle) solicitation primarily for surveillance and reconnaissance with limited manipulative abilities consistent with the abilities of dolphins, primarily limited to attaching recovery lines to objects. This was completed for Johns Hopkins “Management of Systems Projects” course. Management artifacts discussed in full detail included the following:
+ Key Activities: Statement of Work (SOW), Concept of Operations (CONOPS), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Top Level Specification, Critical Path Method (CPM) Network, Schedule, Cost Estimate

#### Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) for Short Range Vehicle Sharing System

+ The team developed a SEMP for a Short Range Vehicle Sharing System (SRVSS) as an effort to develop, test and pilot the SRVSS. This was completed for Johns Hopkins “Introduction to Systems Engineering” course. A SEMP is a top-level plan that describes all relevant aspects related to the management and the process invoked to accomplish the plan.
+ Key Activities:	Program Technical Requirements, Engineering & Resource Management, Technical Activities & Products

#### Senior Design Project - Informed Finance Canary

+ Developing an open source automated financial advisor that will utilize financial articles and parse data to analyze potential stock trends in order to compile risk analysis of a user’s stock portfolio. This combines the ability to associate and weight external factors to create a tailored financial analysis. Analysis of data will be performed through certain machine learning algorithms that can output stock recommendations. Data visualization will alow for the user to self-assess his/her portfolio on up-to-date market trends.

![Autonomous Waste Robot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/robot.jpg "Autonomous Waste Robot")

+ Role: Everything. Solo Project
+ Responsible for building and programming an autonomous waste disposal robot using Lego NXT. This was a very exciting challenge for me since I was able to have experience with Lego NXT in High School. I was introduced to sensor operation, algorithm design and robotics through hands-on-design and course-wide challenge in a decision-making environment. As an objective, I was able to design and build a robot able to autonomously separate trash and nuclear waste, delivering the trash to an incinerator and the nuclear waste to a depot for safe disposal.
