#### Philly Codefest Dean's Innovation Winner - Life Sign
![Codefest_Pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/codefest.PNG "Life Sign")

+ Role: Team Leader, Web Developer, Algorithms
* In 24 hours, we developed a Wi-Fi detection monitoring system that attains information from Wi-Fi enabled devices within a defined threshold. The data was recorded passively via a monitoring USB interface to capture mobile probing

+ Role: Team Leader & Engineer
+ Developed a complete VHDL description of the MIPS-32 CPU and simulated it by executing a set of programs to demonstrate correct functionality of the processor.
+  Simulated, debugged, and tested VHDL code using ModelSim

#### _Let's Go Fishing!_ - Pokemon Fishing Game
![Let's Go Fishing]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/letsGoFishing.png "Let's Go Fishing")

+ Role: Team Leader & Engineer
+ We created a Pokemon based fishing game using a MATLAB GUI as the platform. This was interfaced with an accelerometer that used the arduino as a microcontroller. We were able to successfully implement features such as a Pokemon like loading screen, reeling and casting a fishing rod using the accelerometer and simulating the action and results within MATLAB.

#### Cigna Train YOU Application
+ Role: Team Leader, Engineer, Designer
+ Within my first co-op at CIGNA, I led the TECDP co-ops to create a "proof-of-concept" application called Train YOU as our final project. This consisted of an iOS/Android based application that would encourage Cigna insured users to become healthier and help with the "GO YOU" initiative.

+ Role: Team Leader, Researcher, Developer
+ Worked with a team to use bio-sensing and bio-feedback response systems to simulated biomedical signals important in medical applications, develop a wristband that detects hypoglycemia through measurement of heart rate and detection of excess sweating.

#### Autonomous Waste Robot
![Autonomous Waste Robot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/robot.jpg "Autonomous Waste Robot")

+ Role: Everything. Solo Project
+ Responsible for building and programming an autonomous waste disposal robot using Lego NXT. This was a very exciting challenge for me since I was able to have experience with Lego NXT in High School. I was introduced to sensor operation, algorithm design and robotics through hands-on-design and course-wide challenge in a decision-making environment. As an objective, I was able to design and build a robot able to autonomously separate trash and nuclear waste, delivering the trash to an incinerator and the nuclear waste to a depot for safe disposal.
