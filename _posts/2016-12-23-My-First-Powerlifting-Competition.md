title: My First Powerlifting Competition
---

### Introduction 

This past month I competed in my first powerlifting competition. Powerlifting has been a hobby of mine for the past year and I wanted to see how far I could push myself. I competed within the USAPL which is a drug tested federation and weighed in below 66 kg (145 freedom units). My goals were to beat a state deadlift record (spoiler alert: I did!) and go 9/9 on all of my attempts.

### Training 

I hopped on the GZCL UHF train and followed the 5 week program after stalling for the second time on Candito's 6 week program. I love the entire program and plan to follow it again until my next meet in February (Liberty Bell Classic). I was worried that I would be called on depth so I had conservative numbers for the meet but ended up getting only 1 red light on my last bench.
